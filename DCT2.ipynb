    "## Pydantic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework that brings structure and type safety to LLM applications. Unlike basic LLM integrations that return raw text, Pydantic AI treats AI interactions as structured conversations with validated inputs and outputs, making it easier to build reliable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features and benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structured output validation — Your AI responses automatically conform to Pydantic models, preventing parsing errors and ensuring data consistency\n",
    "* Function tools — LLMs can call your Python functions during conversations, giving them access to real data and computations\n",
    "* Type safety — Full typing support means fewer runtime errors and better IDE assistance when building complex AI workflows\n",
    "* System prompts — Define clear instructions for your AI agents that stay consistent across all interactions\n",
    "* Dependency injection — Share context, database connections, and user preferences across all agent components cleanly\n",
    "* Multiple execution modes — Run agents synchronously, asynchronously, or stream responses in real-time based on your needs\n",
    "* Agent reusability — Create agents once and reuse them throughout your application, similar to FastAPI routers"
